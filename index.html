    <p>
        "Good health and well-being" is a fundamental aspect of human life and is also one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3). It encompasses physical, mental, and social well-being, aiming for a holistic state of being where individuals can thrive and fulfill their potential.

Achieving good health involves access to quality healthcare services, nutritious food, clean water, and adequate sanitation. It also requires promoting mental health, preventing diseases, and ensuring access to essential medicines and vaccines.

Well-being goes beyond absence of illness; it includes happiness, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose in life. Factors such as education, employment, social support, and a safe environment contribute significantly to overall well-being.

      <h2>Facts About Food</h2>
      <aside>
        Here are some facts about food by the World Health Organization (WHO):
        <ul>
          <li>Food safety is a global concern affecting people of all ages:Food safety is a pressing global concern that affects individuals of all ages around the world. Unsafe food can have severe health consequences, ranging from mild gastrointestinal discomfort to serious foodborne diseases, which pose a heightened risk to vulnerable populations such as young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. Beyond health implications, foodborne illnesses also incur substantial economic costs through medical expenses, lost productivity, and the expenses associated with food recalls and investigations. Addressing food safety requires international collaboration to ensure that food is safe throughout its production, processing, storage, and preparation stages. Preventive measures advocated by organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) include promoting proper hygiene practices, ensuring thorough cooking of food, maintaining safe water supplies, regulating storage temperatures, and implementing effective food handling and preparation techniques. Countries often establish regulatory frameworks aligned with international standards set by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to safeguard food safety. By raising awareness and implementing robust measures, global efforts can mitigate the risks associated with unsafe food practices and protect public health worldwide.</li>
          <hr>
          <li>Poor food safety practices can lead to diseases such as diarrhea:Poor food safety practices significantly increase the risk of contracting diseases such as diarrhea, highlighting the critical importance of proper food handling and hygiene. Diarrhea is a common consequence of consuming contaminated food or water contaminated with pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to severe dehydration and even death, particularly in vulnerable populations like young children and individuals with compromised immune systems. Preventing foodborne illnesses like diarrhea requires adherence to strict food safety measures throughout the food chain, from production and processing to preparation and consumption. Effective strategies include ensuring cleanliness during food handling, cooking food thoroughly to kill harmful microorganisms, maintaining proper storage temperatures, and using safe water sources. Public health agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), emphasize education and enforcement of food safety regulations to reduce the incidence of foodborne diseases and safeguard public health globally.</li>

        <p>June 28, 2024 â€“ In a shifting landscape in dementia risk factors, cardiovascular health (or the health of your heart and blood vessels) is now taking precedence.

            That's according to researchers from University College London (UCL) in the United Kingdom who analyzed 27 papers about dementia that had data collected over more than 70 years. They calculated what share of dementia cases were due to different risk factors. Their findings were recently published in The Lancet Public Health. 
            
            Top risk factors for dementia over the years have been hypertension, obesity, diabetes, education, and smoking, according to a news release on the findings. But the prevalence of risk factors has changed over the decades.</p>

        <b>Finland will begin preemptive bird flu vaccinations for certain workers next week, becoming the first country to do so. The initiative targets those in high-risk professions such as fur and poultry farming.</b>
        <p>Finland will start offering preemptive bird flu vaccinations to certain workers exposed to animals as early as next week, making it the first country to do so, health authorities announced.

            The country has secured vaccines for 10,000 people through a joint EU procurement effort, which included up to 40 million doses for 15 nations from CSL Seqirus, an Australian manufacturer.
            
            CSL Seqirus confirmed to news agency Reuters that Finland would be the first to roll out the vaccine.

    <b>A new study from China has found that increased screen time is significantly associated with a higher risk of myopia in children and adolescents. The findings highlight the need for parents to monitor and limit screen exposure to protect their children's eye health.</b>
    <p>Myopia, or nearsightedness, makes distant objects appear blurry while close objects remain clear. This condition occurs when the eye's shape causes light rays to bend incorrectly.

        A recent study, published in BMC Public Health, reviewed and analysed the link between screen time and myopia in children and adolescents.
        
        Researchers from Soochow University in China assessed various studies to determine how screen exposure affects the risk of developing myopia.

                    <p>"Stress-induced IBS , Dyspepsia and gastritis usually cause symptoms like change in bowel habits, constant abdominal pain, bloating, hyperacidity, anorexia etc. The pts will constantly feel some kind of abdominal discomfort. It is difficult for the patient to differentiate between symptoms. The doctor has to get all relevant tests done. If all tests are normal and yet the patient has unexplained symptoms and is not responding to medications, the treating doctor will evaluate for stress and anxiety is the cause of the symptoms", said Dr Dubey

                        But wait, thereâ€™s more. Itâ€™s not just about decoding symptoms; itâ€™s about tackling the root causes, stress being a chief culprit. Gastrointestinal warriors are not alone in this battle; they are armed with strategies to combat stress, from mindfulness techniques to tailored dietary advice. After all, a happy gut is resilient, ready to face whatever life throws its way.
